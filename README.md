# AI Essay Detector

## Overview

The AI Essay Detector is a project designed to determine whether an essay is likely written by an AI model using OpenAI's GPT-3. It utilizes advanced text similarity metrics, such as Jaccard similarity, to compare the content of the original essay and multiple responses generated by the GPT-3 model.
